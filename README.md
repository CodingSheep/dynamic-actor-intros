# Dynamic Actor Intros

Built using [Yakuza-fy](https://github.com/WiNG-CoMM/yakuza-fy) by WiNG-CoMM as the base code, licensed under GNU GPL v3.

This module, much like its base, is a FoundryVTT module that takes the flair added by the **Yakuza / Ryu Ga Gotaku** series and brings it to your TTRPG games.

## Features
Dynamic Actor Intros expands on Yakuza-fy with the following features:
- **Macro Creation.** As opposed to needing Journal Entries to create Dynamic Intros, creation is entirely done from the Actor Context Menu. Upon creating your intro, it is saved to your Macro Directory, ensuring you'll always have quick access to it.
- **Improved Customization.** You have the option to change the font, text color, and text shadow color.
- **Expanded Font Support.** In addition to the default EDO SZ font used in the Yakuza franchise and in the Yakuza-fy module, you can add any font (.ttf, .otf, .woff) to the fonts folder of the module. Upon refreshing the fonts list in the settings menu, it'll be added as permanent addition to any TTRPG game you run!
