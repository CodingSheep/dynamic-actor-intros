# Dynamic Actor Intros

Built using [Yakuza-fy](https://github.com/WiNG-CoMM/yakuza-fy) by WiNG-CoMM as the base code, licensed under GNU GPL v3.

This module, much like its base, is a FoundryVTT module that takes the flair added by the **Yakuza / Ryu Ga Gotaku** series and brings it to your TTRPG games.

## Features
Dynamic Actor Intros expands on Yakuza-fy with the following features:
- **Macro Creation.** As opposed to needing Journal Entries to create Dynamic Intros, creation is entirely done from the Actor Context Menu. Upon creating your intro, it is saved to your Macro Directory, ensuring you'll always have quick access to it.
- **Improved Customization.** You have the option to change the font, text color, and text shadow color.
- **Expanded Font Support.** In addition to the default EDO SZ font used in the Yakuza franchise and in the Yakuza-fy module, you can add any font (.ttf, .otf, .woff) to the fonts folder of the module. Upon refreshing the fonts list in the settings menu, it'll be added as permanent addition to any TTRPG game you run!

## How to Use
1) Create an Actor you'd like to make an intro for
2) Right-click the Actor Context Menu or Click the "Dynamic Actor Intro" button under Token Controls
3) Fill in the form with any details you'd like. Test your settings or save them to a Macro.
4) Your Dynamic Intro is now saved to your Macro Directory. You can now use it like any Macro in Foundry!
