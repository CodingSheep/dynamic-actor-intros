All base inspiration and initial code belongs to [Yakuza-fy](https://github.com/WiNG-CoMM/yakuza-fy) by WiNG-CoMM. This module would not exist without them.

Dynamic Actor Intros intends on expanding on the base functionality of Yakuza-fy, moving the creation of the flair of the **Yakuza / Ryu Ga Gotoku** series from Journal Entries to the Actor Context Menu and a Dialog box.

This is also my foray into learning Javascript, CSS, FoundryVTT's API, and more.
