# Changelog

## 1.0.4 - 2025-10-08
- Code Refactoring and cleaning up weird spacing from file transfer. Should have been handled as part of 1.0.3.

## 1.0.3 - 2025-10-08
- The official creation of the Changelog.
- Added a Button to Token Controls to create a Dynamic Intro for a selected token
- All Macros created now default to a folder in the Macro Directory so you can more easily find them.
- An optional Font Directory can be specified so you no longer need to use the default module directory to store all your added fonts.
- The "Test Intro" button no longer deletes your inputted form. It now persists between tests (but closing the dialog box will lose all changes).

## 1.0.2 - 2025-10-07
- Added Module Settings for default fonts, default text color, and default text shadow color.
- Better Macro Editing. It now checks if a macro for a given actor already exists and loads up those settings.
- Better README. Manifest added for installation support.
- General code clean-up. Some legacy code and minor redundancy still exists.

## 1.0.1 - 2025-10-06
- Added support for any number of fonts via CSS injection.
- Changed functionality from requiring GMs to make the intro on the spot to Macro Creation. They are saved to the Macro directory.
- Added a Test button to test an intro. It'll only pop for the GM.

# 1.0.0 - 2025-10-04
- Initial Module "Creation" (This is a modification of Yakuza-fy by WiNG-CoMM that's slowly expanding its scope).
- GNU GPL v3 License and README added.
